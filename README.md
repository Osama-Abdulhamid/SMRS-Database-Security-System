# SMRS-Database-Security-System

✅ Project Update: SMRS - Database Security System

I am happy to announce the completion of my Database Security project using Python and SQL Server.

The goal was to build a system that doesn't just manage records but protects them. We implemented real-time data encryption and secure user authentication methods to ensure maximum security.

👨‍💻 Technical Highlights:

Dynamic Python-SQL Connectivity.

Advanced Environment Configuration (ODBC/TCP-IP).

Secure Data Handling.
